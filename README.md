LSTM NIFTY 50 Price Prediction (Practice Project)
This project was created for learning and practice purposes to understand time series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks in TensorFlow.
The model is trained on historical NIFTY 50 market data and demonstrates:
Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
Feature scaling
Sequence generation using sliding windows
Building and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
Basic visualization of predictions
Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debashis74017/nifty-50-minute-data/data
All dataset rights belong to the original author on Kaggle.
Purpose
This repository is not intended for production or financial decision-making.
It was developed purely for:
Academic learning
Understanding LSTM architecture
Practicing time-series modeling
Experimenting with stock data preprocessing
